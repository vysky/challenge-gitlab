# challenge-gitlab

this challenge is to automate the [installation of gitlab on microsoft auzre](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/install/azure/#deploy-and-configure-gitlab) (acloudguru azure sandbox) using terraform and ansible

## getting started

### prerequisites

ensure you have the following prepared and installed on your machine

1. python
2. [az cli](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)
2. [terraform](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli)
3. [ansible](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/index.html)
4. username and password provided by acloudguru azure sandbox (or your own azure account)

### running terraform and ansible

#### 1. preparing the code

1. you can either `git clone` or download the code as zip file and extract it to a directory on your machine

#### 2. preparing terraform `main.tf` file

1. login to azure portal using the username and password generated by acloudgure azure sandbox
2. copy the generated resource group name in azure portal
3. open `main.tf` file and replace the `default` value of `variable "rg"` with the copied resource group name
4. save the `main.tf` file

#### 3. running terraform `main.tf` file

1. open a terminal on your machine and navigate to the code directory
2. type `az logout` to logout of any previous az sessions
3. type `az login -u <username>` to login to az using the generated username
4. enter the generated password when prompted
5. begin the initialization of terraform using `terraform init`
6. (optional) plan terraform using `terraform plan`
7. apply terraform using `terraform apply --auto-approve` and wait for it to complete
8. when completed, resources will be deployed in azure portal and three files (inventory, fqdn, password) will be generated in the working directory for use in ansible

note

```
while terraform will report the deployment is completed, the resources are still spining up in the background in azure and will not be ready straight away

thus it is recommended to wait for around 5 to 10 mins before proceeding to the next step

though you are encouraged to try and experiment with this for your own learning
```

#### 4. running ansible `main.yml` file

1. ensure you are still in the same directory in the terminal
2. type `ansible-playbook main.yml` to start the process
3. when completed, you should be able to access the gitlab login page using the fqdn (url) generated in the `fqdn` file

#### 5. terraform destroy and cleaning up
1. in terminal, type `terraform destroy --auto-approve` to destroy the resources created and files generated on local machine

### finding the sku of gitlab

to install gitlab onto a vm, we are required to use the image provided by gitlab

in azure portal, we only need to do a search to find the gitlab image and use it to create the vm we need. however in terraform, we are required to provide `publisher`, `offer` and `sku` of said image to automate and create the vm

there are multiple methods to find the required parameters of the gitlab image (or other images by other publishers), as follow

#### 1. arm template and az powershell

this [fantastic article](https://vincentlauzon.com/2018/01/10/finding-a-vm-image-reference-publisher-sku/) guide you on how to find `publisher`, `offer` and `sku` through arm (azure resource manager) template and az powershell

#### 2. az cli

this [az vm image document](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/vm/image) by microsoft lists the commands to find `publisher`, `offer` and `sku`

example instructions for az cli to find the sku of gitlab by first finding the `publisher` , then `offer`, and finally `sku`
1. ensure you are login to az in terminal using `az login -u <username>` and enter the password when prompted
2. type `az vm image list-publishers --location eastus > publisher.txt` in terminal to output a txt file with a list publishers in eastus
3. open the publisher txt file and search for `gitlab` (there may be multiple results) and note down the `name` value (as of 17 Mar 2022, `gitlabinc1586447921813` is the correct publisher for the image)
4. type `az vm image list-offers --location eastus --publisher gitlabinc1586447921813 > offer.txt` in terminal to output a txt file with a list of offers by `gitlabinc1586447921813`
5. open the offer txt file and note down the `name` value (it should be `gitlabee`)
6. type `az vm image list-skus --location eastus --offer gitlabee --publisher gitlabinc1586447921813 > sku.txt` in terminal to output a txt file with a list of skus
7. open the sku txt file and note down the `name` value (it should be `default`)
